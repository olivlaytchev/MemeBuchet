**MemeBuchet is a 1 vs 1 fast paced action game with trebuchets.** The main theme of the game is a meme war between the most recent and loved memes such as DatBoi üê∏ and Harambe ü¶ç. The whole project was made in less than 24 hours at the [Brumhack 5 Hackathon](https://www.brumhack.co.uk/) in [Birmingham, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham).

# Download the game/project

We made it easy for you to download and get started with the game. All you have to do is `git clone https://github.com/tymscar/MemeBuchet`

# Play the game

After the game is downloaded, execute the included `memebuchet.exe` file and you are ready to go.
Following the main menu is the Character select menu. Here, both players are allowed to lock in a meme they want to play as.
When this is done the battle begins. The `Red` player is on the left and the `Green` player is on the right.
The main objective of the game is to kick the other players trebuchet off of their respective platform using the meme projectiles on hand. 
When one of the player falls off on the ground it's Game Over.

# Controls

Being a local two player game, the controls are simpler so as to be integrated in a single keyboard.
- On the character select screen : The green player moves the selection with `Left arrow` and `Right arrow` and selects the character with `Enter/Return`. The red player moves the selection with `A` and `D` and selects the character with `Spacebar`.
- While in game : To launch a projectile the Red player is required to press `Q` while the Green player uses the `E` key to fire.
- To restart the game press `R`.
